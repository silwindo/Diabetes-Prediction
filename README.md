# Diabetes-Prediction
Do you know 440,000 Singaporeans has diabetes in 2014? Estimated to go up to 1 mil by 2050 • Financial Impact on health costs and productivity : $1.02 mil in 2010 to $2.5bil in 2050 • 1 in 3 people with diabetes unaware of having the condition. Machine Learning can be used to predict onset of early Diabetes and prevent deterioration. 
Extensive EDA and Data Wrangling done on Diabetes Features.
Trained Machine Learning Models to predict Diabetes using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors
